Outbreak Preparedness, Detection, & Response Tools for STI Health Programs

Overview
This project investigates the tools, challenges, and response strategies associated with managing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States. The work highlights how data-driven tools like the CDC's SPACE Tool 2.0 can enhance public health response and funding allocation in the context of STI outbreaks.

Objectives
- Assess current challenges in STI outbreak preparedness and response.
- Explore the use of the CDC’s SPACE Tool 2.0 for estimating STI prevention funding impacts.
- Evaluate strategies used by local health departments, with a case study of the Western Upper Peninsula Health Department.

Key Concepts
- SPACE 2.0 Tool: A model that estimates infection rates and financial impact based on federal funding levels.
- Health Disparities: Focus on vulnerable populations such as sex workers and low-income individuals.
- Resource Allocation: Insights into how funding cuts directly affect STI prevention efforts in local communities.
- Community Engagement: Importance of Community Health Assessments (CHAs) and Improvement Plans (CHIPs).

 Methodology
- Conducted literature review and analysis of public STI statistics (2021 vs 2023).
- Evaluated CDC’s SPACE Tool methodology and assumptions.
- Analyzed the impact of public health funding cuts and local efforts in Michigan.
- Compared reported infection rates, reinfection trends, and response strategies.

 Key Findings
- STI reinfection rates remain a concern, especially for gonorrhea and latent syphilis.
- Budget cuts in 2025 are projected to cause a $398 million reduction in Michigan’s public health funding.
- Community-based assessments play a critical role in identifying gaps and tailoring STI response strategies.
- The SPACE Tool offers a data-driven approach to estimating the return on investment for STI prevention efforts.

My Contributions
- Co-developed the presentation slides and conducted research analysis particulary for slides 1-5.
- Created images/chart for presentation slides 1-5. 
- Evaluated the SPACE Tool methodology and modeled its policy implications.
- Drafted recommendations for future preparedness improvements.
