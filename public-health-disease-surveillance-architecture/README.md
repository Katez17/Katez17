Public Health Disease Surveillance Architecture Development Project
Project Title: Outbreak Preparedness, Detection, & Response Tools for STI Programs**

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and enhancing public health surveillance tools used in the detection, prevention, and response to **sexually transmitted infections (STIs)** in the United States. The project explores data-driven approaches to model the impact of federal funding changes on STI transmission rates and public health costs using real-world data and tools developed by the CDC.

Objectives
- Investigate current tools used in STI outbreak preparedness and response.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the CDC’s SPACE Tool 2.0.
- Highlight funding consequences on STI incidence and cost.
- Recommend strategies for improving public health interventions using data modeling and surveillance.

Technologies & Tools Used
- CDC SPACE Tool 2.0: A data-driven modeling tool used to project STI incidence based on funding levels.
- Data Visualization: Infographics and comparative tables for understanding STI trends and tool effectiveness.
- Statistical Modeling Concepts: Used indirectly via the SPACE Tool for projecting outcomes based on historical data.
- Public Health Needs Assessments: Regional data from the Western Upper Peninsula (WUP) was used for planning and analysis.

Key Challenges
- Data Privacy and Sharing: Balancing the need for detailed surveillance data with HIPAA and privacy regulations.
- Public Stigma: Cultural and societal stigma around STIs hinder outreach and early detection efforts.
- Asymptomatic Transmission: Many STIs show no symptoms, complicating timely diagnosis.
- Underfunded Infrastructure: Persistent budget cuts have hampered the capabilities of local health departments.
- Health Professional Shortages: Rural areas, like Michigan's Upper Peninsula, suffer from clinician shortages.

Outcomes
- Provided an overview of SPACE Tool 2.0 methodology:
  - Input of jurisdiction-level case data and funding history.
  - Modeled predictions of STI incidence based on funding changes.
  - Estimated economic impact using cost-of-illness metrics.
- Used Western UP Health Department data to assess STI trends (2021 vs. 2023) and identify priority areas.
- Demonstrated how surveillance tools can be used to **justify budget allocation** and inform local decision-making.
- Formulated strategic recommendations for community-based STI response and future tool development.

Notable Findings
- Significant decline in reported chlamydia cases between 2021 and 2023 in the WUP region.
- Re-infection rates of gonorrhea increased, suggesting the need for stronger partner notification and treatment protocols.
- Evidence of **declining public STI services** correlating with funding cuts—emphasizing the importance of data-driven budget advocacy.

Recommendations
- Sustain and expand the use of SPACE Tool 2.0 and similar predictive models.
- Increase public awareness campaigns and destigmatize STI testing.
- Promote partnerships between public health authorities, clinics, and community-based organizations.
- Advocate for **restored funding to CDC STI prevention programs** affected by recent federal budget cuts.
